Created a comprehensive VHDL testbench to verify functional correctness of “Add” and “AC” operations, including state transitions and output waveform validation. Utilized Xilinx Vivado for simulation and synthesis; performed waveform analysis to debug and verify internal states using testbench stimulus and scope probing. Mapped the design onto a physical FPGA board with a custom constraints file to interface slide switches, LEDs, pushbuttons, and a 100MHz clock.",
